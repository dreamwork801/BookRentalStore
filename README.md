# Book Store
This project illistrates event-driven programming using Java GUIs. It is like an e-store that allows you to add books by their id to a shopping cart that calculates a running subtotal. When you finish the order there is an invoice that is created and a record of transactions is saved in a file.<br />

TODO:<br />
-refactor one big file into several different files<br />
-Improve GUI<br />
-Add input validation<br />
-Implement a library option where you don't have price, but it lets the user know who has that book checked out<br />
